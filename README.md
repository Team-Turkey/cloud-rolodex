## Description 
* Finally, you can throw away that 10 year old scrap of paper that’s taped to the break-room fridge. 
* You know the one, it has your co-worker’s phone number and email, but it’s been crossed off and re-written. What’s worse, half the people on the sheet don’t even work there anymore!
* Introducing the 21st century solution, Cloud Rolodex! This easy to use application allows companies to build a database of employees, which allow logged-in users to update their own information, or to search for another employee in any department, or to view all employees in any department.
